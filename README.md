- API keys for AI services (optional)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/takitajwar17/lumenly.dev.git
cd lumenly.dev
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create and configure a Convex project:
```bash
npx convex login
npx convex init
```

4. Create a `.env` file with your environment variables:
```
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=
CONVEX_NEBIUS_API_KEY=  # Optional, for AI code reviews
```

5. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will start at http://localhost:5173

## üìñ Usage

### User Flow

The typical user flow in lumenly.dev follows these paths:

1. **Authentication Flow:**
   - User visits lumenly.dev
   - Authentication check determines if already signed in
   - If not authenticated, user proceeds to sign in

2. **Workspace Selection:**
   - After authentication, user arrives at the Workspace Hub
   - Options include:
     - Creating a new workspace
     - Joining an existing workspace via code
     - Opening a previously saved workspace

3. **Coding Environment:**
   - Inside the workspace, users interact with the Code Editor
   - Multiple users can collaborate simultaneously
   - Real-time changes are visible to all participants

### Creating a Workspace
1. Visit the application and sign in
2. Click "Create a Workspace" to start a new coding space
3. Choose your preferred programming language
4. You'll receive a 6-character workspace code that you can share with collaborators

### Inviting Collaborators
1. Share your workspace code or URL with others
2. Collaborators can join by entering the 6-character code on the home screen
3. You'll see real-time presence indicators and cursor positions as people join

### Running Code
1. Write or paste your code in the editor
2. Click the "Run" button in the toolbar
3. View the execution results, including any output, errors, and execution time

### Getting AI Reviews
1. Write your code in the editor
2. Click the "AI Review" button to get feedback
3. Review the suggestions, issues, and improvements identified by the AI

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

lumenly.dev is built with modern web technologies and a focus on real-time collaboration.

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Monaco Editor (VS Code's editor)
- **Backend:** Convex (real-time database and backend functions)
- **Code Execution:** Piston API (secure code execution environment)
- **AI Services:** Nebius API for code analysis and reviews

### System Overview
The high-level architecture of lumenly.dev consists of several interconnected layers:

- **Frontend Layer:** React-based UI components and hooks
- **Core Components:** Workspace hub, code editor, toolbars, and panels
- **Backend Layer:** Convex backend for data management and real-time synchronization
- **External Services:** Piston API for code execution and Nebius API for AI code reviews

### Key Components
- **Real-time Collaboration:** Built on Convex's real-time database for instant updates
- **Monaco Editor Integration:** Professional code editing with syntax highlighting
- **Presence System:** Track user activity and cursor positions in real-time
- **Code Execution Engine:** Secure, isolated environment for running code in 30+ languages

### Component Interactions
During typical workflows like code execution and AI review:

1. **Code Execution Flow:**
   - User clicks "Run Code" in the editor toolbar
   - Code is sent to the Convex backend
   - Convex sends the code to Piston API for execution
   - Results are returned to the frontend and displayed to the user

2. **AI Review Flow:**
   - User clicks "AI Review" in the editor toolbar
   - Code is sent to the Convex backend
   - Convex forwards the code to Nebius API for analysis
   - AI feedback is formatted and displayed to the user

### Real-time Collaboration Architecture
The real-time collaboration features are powered by Convex backend:

- Convex database synchronizes changes between all connected users
- Custom hooks like `useCodeSync` and `useEditorPresence` manage real-time state
- API endpoints in rooms.ts and userActivity.ts handle data operations
- Updates propagate automatically to all connected clients

### Codebase Organization
The codebase follows a standard React application structure with Convex backend integration:

- **/src:** Frontend React components and hooks
  - `/components`: UI components including editor, toolbar, and panels
  - `/hooks`: Custom React hooks for real-time synchronization
  - `/utils`: Helper functions and utilities
- **/convex:** Backend functions, schema definitions, and APIs
  - API endpoints for rooms, user activity, and code execution
  - Data schema and validation
- **/public:** Static assets and resources
